Act as a pro front-end developer and UI/UX designer. Build a modern, mobile-first, responsive student portfolio website with a white-violet glossy (glassmorphism) aesthetic. The site should feel premium, animation-rich, and have Firebase integration. Follow this feature spec:

🔹 1. Navigation Bar
- Include: Home, About, Projects, Certificates, Contact
- Always-visible “Resume” button (floating or sticky) on both desktop and mobile. Clicking should open/download the resume.

🔹 2. Entry Animation (No Video)
- On first load, show a smooth animated welcome screen with text like “Hi, I’m Bharathi. Welcome to my space.”
- Subtle fade-in or slide animation, with a button like “Enter Portfolio” that transitions into the main site.
- Entire entry should feel minimal, fast, and professional — no video.

🔹 3. Hero / Landing Page
- Show my image, name, role, short tagline.
- Include social icons: GitHub, LinkedIn, Email with clean hover effects.
- Animate text in a typewriter or fade style.
- Must be responsive for all screens.

🔹 4. About Me
- Short paragraph about me.
- Apply modern entrance animations (slide/zoom-in/fade).

🔹 5. Education Timeline
- Vertical timeline to show my education (degree, college, dates).
- Each entry animates into view on scroll.

🔹 6. Skills Section
- Animated horizontal scroll (right-to-left auto carousel) showing my tech skills.
- Use icons or chip-style labels with hover animation.

🔹 7. Projects
- Show top 3 featured projects (data pulled from Firebase admin panel).
- Card style with title, tech stack, live/demo link, and GitHub.
- “View All Projects” button goes to full projects page.

🔹 8. Certificates
- Certificate cards slide in left-to-right (carousel-like), similar to https://www.bharathi-portfolio.xyz/

🔹 9. Contact Form
- Firebase Firestore backend to store contact form submissions.
- Fields: Name, Email, Message.
- Toast notification after success.

🔹 10. Floating Chatbot
- Bottom-right chatbot icon.

- It must “speak like me” — friendly but professional tone, no irrelevant chatter.

🔹 11. Admin Panel (/admin)
- Secure login with Firebase Auth.
- Allow managing Projects, Certificates, and Resume link.
- Neat dashboard UI with CRUD functionality.

🔹 12. Design Guidelines
- Theme: White background with violet-glass glow effects.
- Animations: Clean, subtle, micro-interactions (no heavy effects).
- Typography: Minimal, elegant.
- Entire site must be mobile-first, responsive, and polished.

🔹 Deliverables:
- Complete frontend (React preferred, or HTML/JS/CSS)
- Firebase backend (Auth + Firestore)
- Admin panel with Firebase security rules
- JSON/data.js structure for dynamic content
- Instructions for deployment (Netlify or Vercel)
